        <em> Poem for my DART class </em>
        <br>
        <p> I'm in a new class called DART </p>
        <p> For this one, I think you have to be very smart</p>
        <p> Although I don't understand some parts, </p>
        <p> I am going to put all my heart</p>
        <br> 
        <p> I am trying to pay attention</p>
        <p> because learning is my intention</p>
        <p> This is my first time coding, did I mention?</p>
        <p> And it feels like I'm entering the fourth dimension </p>
        <br> 
        <p>I never thought I would learn how to code </p>
        <p> and my mind is ready to blow </p>
        <p> My slides now for some reason don't download </p>
        <p> oh my, learning it's going to be a long road</p>
        <br> 
        <p> Using the computer is something I keep avoiding</p>
        <p> But I realize it only takes exploring </p>
        <p> while my brain keeps loading </p>
        <p> Man, I realize I love coding! </p> 
    <br>
        
        <em> Thank you for enjoying my poem! </em>
